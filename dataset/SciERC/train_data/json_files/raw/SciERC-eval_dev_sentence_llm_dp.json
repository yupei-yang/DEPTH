The clause \"making fine-grained matching harder\" is an adverbial clause modifying the main clause, indicating a consequence of the sketches being abstract.\n\nThe third reason is \"annotated cross-domain sketch-photo datasets required for training are scarce,\" where \"datasets\" is the subject, \"are\" is the main verb, and \"scarce\" is the complement. The phrase \"required for training\" is an adjectival clause modifying \"datasets,\" specifying their purpose.\n\nEach part of the sentence contributes to explaining the challenges, with the use of conjunctions like \"but\" and \"and\" to connect the different aspects of the task's difficulty. The sentence concludes with the impact of these challenges on \"many state-of-the-art machine learning techniques,\" emphasizing the broader implications of the scarcity of suitable datasets."
